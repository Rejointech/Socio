# Rules for contribution
We have some particular set of tags defined to be added to PRs:

P-High: The priority for this tag is very high. Can be of some Core or DB changes and needs to be resolved ASAP.
P-Medium: The priority is not that much as it wouldn't add up breaking changes and don't need to be addressed immediately.
P-Low: The priority is Least as there is small changes like code corrections or refactorings.
